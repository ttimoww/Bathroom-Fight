## Summary
The Bathroom Fight is a simple 2 player board game where it is the goal to defeat your opponent by using the best weapons on the game board. The game has several weapons available:
* Hand (13 atk damage)
* Toothbrush (15 atk damage)
* Wet Towel (17 atk damage)
* Slippers (19 atk damage)
* Plunger (22 atk damage)

## Game Rules
Bob & Sophie will each have separate turns in which they have to change to walk around the board, pick up weapons and attack their opponent.
The player who turns it is can choose to walk around by clicking on an available column or attack their opponent if he or she is next to the player by clicking the 'attack' button on their side next to the board.

If a player bumps into their opponent they may **always attack first**. During an attack turn, the player can also choose 'defend'. When a player is defending, the next damage taken, will only be half the damage made by their opponent.

The player who's health gets to 0 first, loses!
